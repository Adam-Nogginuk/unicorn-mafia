We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Unicorn Mafia project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Adding your company to our member showcase

## Member Company Submissions

To add your company to our member showcase, please ensure it meets our criteria:

### Eligibility Criteria

- Company must have at least one founder or key team member who is part of the Unicorn Mafia community
- Company should be actively building or have built a technology product
- Company information should be publicly verifiable

### How to Submit Your Company

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Edit the `public/companies-data.yaml` file**
3. **Add your company information** following the format below:
4. **Submit a Pull Request**

### Company Information Format

```yaml
- name: "Your Company Name"
  website_url: "https://yourcompany.com"
  logo_url: "https://yourcompany.com/logo.svg" # or favicon.ico
```

That's it! Just 3 simple fields required:

### Logo Guidelines

- **Format**: SVG, PNG, or even favicon.ico works fine

- **Background**: Should work on light backgrounds
- **Tip**: Your website's favicon usually works perfectly!

Simply provide the direct URL to your logo or favicon (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/favicon.ico`)

## Development Process

We use GitHub flow, so all code changes happen through Pull Requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs or added features, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that Pull Request!

## Pull Request Process

1. **Clear Description**: Provide a clear description of what you're changing and why
2. **Testing**: Ensure any new features are properly tested
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Code Style**: Follow the existing code style and conventions

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/unicornmafia/website/issues).

### Bug Reports

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. **Search first**: Check if someone has already suggested it
2. **Be specific**: Clearly describe the feature and its use case
3. **Consider the scope**: Think about how it fits with the project's goals
