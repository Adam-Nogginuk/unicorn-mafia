## Development Process

We use GitHub flow, so all code changes happen through Pull Requests:

2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs or added features, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that Pull Request!

## Pull Request Process

1. **Clear Description**: Provide a clear description of what you're changing and why
2. **Testing**: Ensure any new features are properly tested
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Code Style**: Follow the existing code style and conventions

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/unicornmafia/website/issues).

### Bug Reports

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. **Search first**: Check if someone has already suggested it
2. **Be specific**: Clearly describe the feature and its use case
3. **Consider the scope**: Think about how it fits with the project's goals
